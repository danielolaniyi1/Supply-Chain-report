### Project Overview
Umkhonto is an emerging manufacturer in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, operating in three locations: Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt. The company plans to expand to additional states across Nigeria and serves a diverse range of customers within these regions. It has been observed that some customers have not renewed their contracts due to the failure to deliver essential products on time, in full, or both. This analysis is a critical step in addressing this issue and will serve as the foundation for a series of recommendations and process improvements aimed at enhancing customer service. Umkhonto's planned expansion to other states will be delayed until these changes are implemented and the gap between the targets for OT%, IF%, and OTIF% and the actual performance is significantly reduced.

Recommendations will be presented to the stakeholders, the supply chain department, and other relevant teams to address delivery delays and ensure prompt services to customers. Insights will be delivered to the Director of Umkhonto, the Head of the Supply Chain Department, and the supply planning team.

The data examined spans from March 2022 to August 2022, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as IF% (In Full Percentage), OT% (On-Time Percentage), and OTIF% (On-Time and In-Full Percentage). The analysis compares these performance metrics against their corresponding target values across the cities Umkhonto serves and its various customers


### Objectives
- Analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) against Target Metrics
To analyze the IF% (In Full Percentage), OT% (On-Time Percentage), and OTIF% (On-Time and In-Full Percentage) metrics with respect to their corresponding set targets, spanning the period from March 2022 to August 2022.

- Service Level Performance Comparison across Customers and Cities
To evaluate and compare the service level performance of customers and cities across all three metrics (IF%, OT%, OTIF%) in relation to the set target benchmarks.

- Product and Category Fulfillment Analysis for Warehousing and Distribution
To assess the LIFR% (Line Fill Rate Percentage) and VOFR% (Volume Fill Rate Percentage) on products and product categories for the warehousing and distribution teams, ensuring alignment with fulfillment objectives.

### Exective Summary 
*(This is a brief summary to the Director of Umkhonto)*

From the data provided, it is evident that performance across all key metrics—OT% (On-Time Percentage), IF% (In Full Percentage), and OTIF% (On-Time and In-Full Percentage)—falls significantly short of their respective targets during the period of March 2022 to August 2022.
OTIF% shows the largest gap, with a target of 66% but only achieving 29%, reflecting severe underperformance.
The best performing months below but its important to note that While these months represent the best performance in their respective metrics, the results remain critically below target levels
- March for OT%: Achieved 60% against a target of 86%.
- May for IF%: Achieved 54% against a target of 77%.
- August for OTIF%: Achieved 29% against a target of 66%.

Port Harcourt stores exhibit the worst performance across all metrics, indicating potential operational inefficiencies within this location.
Lotus and Acclaimed stores, despite receiving the highest order volumes, do not have the highest fulfillment rates.
On average, these stores fall 51% short of the OT% target, 13% behind the IF% target, and 42% below the OTIF% target.
Similar trends of underperformance are observed across all other stores and metrics, signaling a widespread issue in meeting delivery targets.


### Comprehensive Report
*(This is a comprehensive meant for the Supply chain Manager)*
This report highlights significant shortcomings in meeting set targets across critical supply chain metrics. Umkhonto's performance was evaluated across three major dimensions: OT% (On-Time Percentage), IF% (In Full Percentage), and OTIF% (On-Time and In-Full Percentage). Additionally, LIFR% (Line Fill Rate Percentage) and VOFR% (Volume Fill Rate Percentage) were partially considered, though their importance was secondary to the primary KPIs.
Line Fill Rate (LIFR%) measures the number of order lines shipped compared to the total ordered but does not account for delivery timeliness.
Volume Fill Rate (VOFR%) tracks the total quantity of items shipped to customers per order or over a given period. This metric is particularly valuable to both the supply chain and manufacturing teams.
These metrics were analyzed at the product category level, city/location level, and monthly trends to provide actionable insights.

Key Metric Trends
OT% (On-Time Percentage):
- Umkhonto achieved better OT% performance compared to IF% and OTIF% across most locations.
- Performance for most stores ranged from 70% to 74%, with the OT% target set at 86%.
- Worst-performing stores: Acclaimed (29%), CoolBlue (29%), and Lotus Mart (28%). Distance and logistics delays may contribute to these low figures.

IF% (In Full Percentage):
- Several stores performed slightly better in this metric:
- Top performers: Real Fresh, Propel Mart, Atlas Stores, Expert Mart, Abim Stores, Logic Stores, Chiptec, and Expression Stores  all range between (59%–61%).
- Worst performers: Elite Mart, Good Value, and Info Stores (38%–41%).

OTIF% (On-Time and In-Full Percentage):
Performance was grouped into three distinct ranges:
- Decent (38%-41%): Most stores fall into this range.
- Bad (24%-28%): Zenith, Good Value, Info Stores, and Elite Mart.
- Worst (13%-16%): Lotus Mart, Acclaimed Stores, and CoolBlue.

Delivery performance varied significantly across cities, particularly in Port Harcourt, where IF% was notably low. Each city had distinct underperforming stores: Good Value in Abuja, with an IF% of 18%; Info Stores in Lagos, with an IF% of 19%; and Elite Mart in Port Harcourt, with an IF% of 16%.
From the line chart drilled to daily performance, key dates with notable results were identified. The best-performing days for OT% were Sunday, May 16, with 67.63%, and Friday, May 27, with 49%. The highest OTIF% recorded was on Saturday, May 28, at 37%.

Dairy products accounted for 79% of total deliveries, making this a critical category for both the manufacturing and supply chain teams. Prioritizing this category is essential to improve overall performance and meet demand more effectively.

This evaluation provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by Umkhonto in meeting its supply chain targets, offering insights that can guide strategic decision-making to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### Recommendations
1. CoolBlue emerged as the worst-performing store, requiring immediate attention to address and resolve the underlying issues contributing to its poor performance.
2. The critically low performance, particularly in OTIF%, highlights systemic challenges in meeting service level agreements. To uncover the root causes of these delays in On-Time and In-Full deliveries, further investigation is required. Specifically:
- Manufacturing Processes: Analysis of production schedules, lead times, and capacity constraints.
- Logistics Operations: Assessment of transportation delays, inventory management, and warehouse operations.
This follow-up investigation will provide deeper insights and help formulate actionable recommendations to improve delivery performance and ensure targets are consistently met.
