### Project Overview
Umkhonto is an emerging manufacturer in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, operating in three locations: Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt. The company plans to expand to additional states across Nigeria and serves a diverse range of customers within these regions. It has been observed that some customers have not renewed their contracts due to the failure to deliver essential products on time, in full, or both. This analysis is a critical step in addressing this issue and will serve as the foundation for a series of recommendations and process improvements aimed at enhancing customer service. Umkhonto's planned expansion to other states will be delayed until these changes are implemented and the gap between the targets for OT%, IF%, and OTIF% and the actual performance is significantly reduced.

Recommendations will be presented to the stakeholders, the supply chain department, and other relevant teams to address delivery delays and ensure prompt services to customers. Insights will be delivered to the Director of Umkhonto, the Head of the Supply Chain Department, and the supply planning team.

The data examined spans from March 2022 to August 2022, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as IF% (In Full Percentage), OT% (On-Time Percentage), and OTIF% (On-Time and In-Full Percentage). The analysis compares these performance metrics against their corresponding target values across the cities Umkhonto serves and its various customers


### Objectives
- Analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) against Target Metrics
To analyze the IF% (In Full Percentage), OT% (On-Time Percentage), and OTIF% (On-Time and In-Full Percentage) metrics with respect to their corresponding set targets, spanning the period from March 2022 to August 2022.

- Service Level Performance Comparison across Customers and Cities
To evaluate and compare the service level performance of customers and cities across all three metrics (IF%, OT%, OTIF%) in relation to the set target benchmarks.

- Product and Category Fulfillment Analysis for Warehousing and Distribution
To assess the LIFR% (Line Fill Rate Percentage) and VOFR% (Volume Fill Rate Percentage) on products and product categories for the warehousing and distribution teams, ensuring alignment with fulfillment objectives.
